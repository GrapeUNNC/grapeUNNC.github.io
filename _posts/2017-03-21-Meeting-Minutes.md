#### Aim: 

To check what we have done last week



---

#### Agenda: 

1.	The changes of user interface
2.	The input function
3.	The Merge sort animation

---

#### Discussion:

1.	The changes of user interface
 *	We change the buttons of choosing algorithm to toggle button. The advantage of using toggle button is it is more clear to see which algorithm has been chosen.
 *	The UI element of switching interface has been changed to tabbed panes.

2.	The input function
 *	The input function is achieved. Users can input value of animation by themselves.
 *	The color of rectangles in the animation can be changed by userâ€™s choice. However, there is bug. When users choose the dark color, the numbers in the rectangles cannot see clearly. It is necessary to find some methods to fix it.

3. The Merge sort animation
 *	There are some problems of merge sort animation. Firstly, the parent pane has been changed from HBox to Pane. It is more difficult to control the position of the animation. Secondly, there are some bugs in the animation. We will try to fix it later.

#### Action Points

1.	Continue to achieve other algorithm animations
2.	Improve the input function
3.	Fix the bug of the merge sort animation
4.	Add more related functions of animation
