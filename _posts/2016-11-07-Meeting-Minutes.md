#### Aim: 

To discuss the progress of our project

---

#### Agenda: 

1. Requirement Specification V3
2. Website design
3. GUI deisign
4. Suggestion on system architecture

---

#### Discussion:

1. Requirement Specification V3
	* We decided to modify the Introduction part to make the requirement specification fit in interim report.
	* We decided to make some user stories and UML design, then put them in a motivation part in interim report rather than requirement specification part.
2. Website design
	* We decided to improve the home page of website in the following two parts
	  1)	The homepage should introduce the software and its main function.
	  2)	The homepage should explain why our group is called “Grape”.
	* We decided that the function of comment is not necessary.
3. GUI design
	* We decided to improve the mainframe part
	  1)	The choosing algorithm button should show the full name of sort algorithm.
	  2)	The input box should prompt users the format of input.
	  3)	The progress bar should be under the bar graph.
	  4)	We will decide where to put the “Random generate” button.
	* We decided to improve the comparison part
	  1)	We will reduce the number of choosing algorithm button to 2.
	  2)	We will show the complexity of two algorithms in one coordinate system.
	  3)	We will consider how the design the “Stop” button.
	  4)	We will consider the relation between input size and complexity in coordinate system.
4. Suggestion on system architecture
	* We decided to focus on one algorithm and try to implement its main function.
