#### Supervisors: 

Heshan DU

#### Aim: 

To check the process of our project


---

#### Agenda: 

1.  The changes of user interface
2.	The animation code
3.	Combination of the user interface and animation



---

#### Discussion:

1. The changes of user interface

	* We use a new Javafx library to make some UI elements more fancy and colorful

2. The animation code
	* The insertion sort and bubble sort animations are achieved.  
	* We decide to use “transition” rather than “timeline” in our code, because the timeline function cannot achieve playing animation continually.

3. Combination of the user interface and animation
	* The achieved algorithm animations are combined to the user interface. There is also some weakness like the position of the objects. It should be improved later.

#### Action Points

1.	Try to achieve other algorithm animations
2.	Achieve some important function with animation, such as input value.
3.	Improve the play button design
