#### Aim: 

To check the progress and make a plan for this semester

---

#### Agenda: 

1.	Discuss having a test user group
2.	Discuss the interface improvement
3.	Make a plan for this semester

---

#### Discussion:

1. Discuss having a test user group
	* Last semester we decide to find several PhD students or tutors to be our stakeholders. Now we think having a test user group is also a good way to improve our project, so we will decide to choose one of them as soon as possible.
2. Discuss the interface improvement
	* The tool bar should be more detailed and specific, for example, the meaning of bars---“File”, “Run” and “Edit” are ambiguous, users cannot easily know which part the bars are used for. And the “Select” bar should be corresponding to “Single algorithm visualization” page, meanwhile the “Compare” bar should be corresponding to “Comparison between algorithms” page. In addition, we need to implement the specific function of every tool bar.
	* The part to select sorting algorithms should be simple to operate and obvious, so we decide to put it on the left side of main page.
	* The speed control bar is a little bit short, so we can make it like a vertical control bar used to control volume, or adjust the bar to be longer.
3.  Make a plan for this semester
	* According to what we have done last semester, now we will focus on the PC version of our project, and we will try to make the software run normally before April. As for the near-term target, we will try to make several sorting algorithms` animation besides bubble sort.
