Questionnaire template	* Firstly, we discussed the context of the questionnaire template. Some questions of it are not suitable, so we decided to make questions more specific and focus on smaller group like classmates.  	* Then, we discussed research checklist. There are some problems need to be revised, such as the relevance of secondary data sets. In addition, we knew there is some jobs of making a questionnaire, such as attaching information sheet and assigning identified id number, etc.3. Requirement specification	* We discussed that how to write the requirement specification of our software. The specification should describe functions of our software. A method is to search online and find some templates as a reference.4. Report	* We discussed that when we should start to write interim report. We decided to accomplish a draft of interim report two weeks earlier than the deadline to have enough time to revise.
