#### Discussion:

1. Stakeholder issue
	* We have talk about this question with Danny, a PHD student in our school, but he is too busy to do some other works. Therefore, we would like to ask some other people about the stakeholder, such as professor Eugen, tutor Manish and some other PHD students. Since Paul has agreed to be our stakeholder, we only need to find two stakeholders more. 
2. Interim report
	* Since there are too many coursework in last week, we didnâ€™t do too much about report. But we already have a specific division of labor. We will start to write the draft of report during this week.
3. GUI feedback
	* The mainframe and compared frame design is ok, but we need to decide how to change these two pages and the function of tool bar.
4. UML feedback
	* We have made a UML diagram draft, but it still has some problems in small parts. The meanings of different arrows are not very clear.
